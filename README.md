## üöÄ Installation

### Download from Releases (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/shorins/return-launchpad/tree/main/release-versions)
2. Download the latest `Return-Launchpad-v*.dmg` file
3. Open the DMG and drag Return Launchpad to your Applications folder
4. **Important**: Right-click the app and select "Open" the first time to bypass Gatekeeper
5. Grant necessary permissions when prompted

### Build from Source

#### Prerequisites
- macOS 15.5 (Sequoia) or later
- Xcode 16.4 or later
- Apple Developer account (for code signing)

#### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shorins/return-launchpad.git
   cd return-launchpad
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open "Return Launchpad.xcodeproj"
   ```

3. **Configure signing**:
   - Select the project in Xcode navigator
   - Choose your development team in "Signing & Capabilities"
   - Ensure "Automatically manage signing" is enabled

4. **Build and run**:
   - Press `‚åòR` to build and run
   - Or use: `‚åòB` to build, then run the app from Products

#### Command Line Build

```bash
# Build the project
xcodebuild -project "Return Launchpad.xcodeproj" -scheme "Return Launchpad" -destination 'platform=macOS' build

# Create archive for distribution
xcodebuild -project "Return Launchpad.xcodeproj" -scheme "Return Launchpad" -destination 'platform=macOS' archive -archivePath "Return Launchpad.xcarchive"
```

## üìñ Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the app** from Applications folder or Spotlight
2. **Grant permissions** if prompted (for accessing application directories)
3. The launcher will appear as a full-screen overlay with all your apps

### Basic Operations

- **Search**: Start typing to filter applications in real-time
- **Navigate**: Use left/right arrow keys to browse pages
- **Launch App**: Click any app icon to launch it (launcher closes automatically)
- **Close Launcher**: Click outside the grid area or press Escape
- **Rearrange Apps**: Drag and drop app icons to customize their order

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Type` | Search/filter applications |
| `‚Üê ‚Üí` | Navigate between pages |
| `Escape` | Close launcher |
| `Enter` | Launch selected/first app in search results |

### Tips for Best Experience

- **Organize by usage**: Drag frequently used apps to the first page
- **Use search for speed**: Type a few letters instead of browsing
- **Multiple monitors**: The launcher appears on the active screen
- **Performance**: The app is optimized for smooth performance with 200+ applications

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Return Launchpad follows a clean **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture using SwiftUI's reactive programming model.

### Architecture Overview

    style B fill:#7ed321,stroke:#333
    style D fill:#f5a623,stroke:#333
```

### Core Components

#### **AppManager** (ViewModel)
- Central state coordinator using `ObservableObject`
- Manages application list, search queries, and pagination
- Coordinates with `AppOrderManager` for persistent custom ordering
- Publishes state changes to trigger UI updates

#### **ContentView** (View)
- Main UI implementation using SwiftUI
- Responsive grid layout with `LazyVGrid`
- Search interface and pagination controls
- Handles user interactions and keyboard events

#### **AppInfo** (Model)
- Data structure representing individual applications
- Contains app metadata: name, icon, URL, bundle identifier
- Conforms to `Identifiable`, `Hashable`, and `Codable`

#### **AppScanner** (Service)
- Discovers installed applications in standard directories
- Extracts app metadata from bundle information
- Handles icon extraction with fallback strategies

#### **AppOrderManager** (Persistence)
- Manages custom app ordering and arrangement
- Persists user preferences using UserDefaults
- Handles drag-and-drop reordering logic

### Key Design Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: SwiftUI's `@Published` and `@ObservableObject`
- **Dependency Injection**: Environment objects for state sharing
- **Repository Pattern**: `AppScanner` encapsulates data access logic
- **Command Pattern**: User actions trigger state changes through AppManager

### Technology Stack

- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI (declarative UI)
- **Language**: Swift 5.9+
- **System Integration**: AppKit (NSVisualEffectView, NSWorkspace)
- **Build System**: Xcode/xcodebuild
- **Persistence**: UserDefaults and Property Lists
- **Package Management**: Native Xcode (no external dependencies)

- ‚ùå **No third-party services**: No external dependencies or services

### What We DO

- ‚úÖ **Local-only operation**: All data stays on your Mac
- ‚úÖ **Standard macOS permissions**: Only requests necessary file access
- ‚úÖ **Transparent operation**: Open-source code for full transparency
- ‚úÖ **Minimal footprint**: Only accesses application directories for scanning

### Permissions Required

- **File System Access**: To scan `/Applications` and `~/Applications` directories
- **Accessibility** (optional): For enhanced keyboard navigation features

All permissions are used solely for core functionality and never for data collection.
